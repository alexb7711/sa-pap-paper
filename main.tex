\abstract {With an increasing adoption of Battery Electric Bus (BEB) fleets, developing a reliable charging schedule is vital to a successful migration from their fossil fuel counterparts. In this paper, a Simulated Annealing (SA) implementation is developed for a charge scheduling framework for a fixed-schedule fleet of BEBs that utilizes a proportional battery dynamics model, accounts for multiple charger types, allows partial charging, and further considers the total energy consumed by the schedule as well as peak power use. Two generation mechanisms are implemented for the SA algorithm denoted as the "quick" and "heuristic" implementations, respectively. The model validity is demonstrated by utilizing a set of routes sampled from the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) and comparing the results against two other models: the BPAP and the Qin-Modified. The results presented show that both SA techniques offer a means of generating operationally feasible schedules quickly while minimizing the cost of operation and considering battery health.}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:sa-introduction}
With an ever-increasing interest in the electrification of vehicles in the push for green transportation, many
organizations and companies have been looking to adopt a fleet of electric vehicles \cite{khan-2022-inves}. This
transition includes battery electric buses (BEBs) \cite{li-2016-batter-elect,guida-2017-zeeus-repor-europ}. In
particular, agencies such as the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) have directed focus in replacing their fleets with BEBs.
Alongside all the benefits that are associated with BEBs come new challenges that must be addressed prior to their
integration into mainstream utilization. The energy storage capacity of BEBs is typically significantly less than their
combustion counterparts while also having significantly longer refueling periods
\cite{xylia-2018-role-charg,li-2016-batter-elect}. This is further complicated due to the care that must be taken in
prolonging the lifespan of the battery \cite{lutsey-2019-updat-elect,edge-2021-lithium,millner-2010-model-lithium}.
As another complication, BEB refueling is not a fixed cost (i.e. price per gallon multiplied by tank size). Utility
companies, in addition to charging for the total energy consumed over a pay period, often charge a demand cost. The
demand cost is based on the peak power drawn during the pay period and can significantly impact the overall monetary
cost of maintaining the BEBs. This work introduces a scheduling framework for a fleet of BEBs that minimizes charging
costs while considering other constraints pertinent for operation.

A host of strategies have been proposed to solve the BEB charger scheduling problem. Strategies vary in terms of their
basic formulation, many using variations of the vehicle scheduling problem
\cite{zhang-2021-optim-elect,duan-2021-refor-mixed,rinaldi-2020-mixed-fleet,tang-2019-robus-sched,li-2014-trans-bus,he-2020-optim-charg}
while \cite{whitaker-2023-a-network} utilizes a network flow approach and \cite{brown-2024-posit-alloc} utilizes a
rectangle packing approach referred to as the Position Allocation Problem (PAP). Some works assume that BEBs always
charge to full capacity each time they connect to a charger
\cite{duan-2021-refor-mixed,zhang-2021-optim-elect,zhou-2020-bi-objec,wang-2017-elect-vehic}, while others allow for
partial charging using a linear battery charge model
\cite{wei-2018-optim-spatio,he-2020-optim-charg,mortensen-2023-cost-minim}, and others use a higher-fidelity,
non-linear battery model
\cite{whitaker-2023-a-network,zhang-2021-optim-elect,qin-2016-numer-analy,jahic-2019-preem,frendo-2021-open-sourc}.
Some works consider only fast chargers during planing
\cite{zhou-2020-collab-optim,li-2014-trans-bus,wang-2017-optim-rechar,sebastiani-2016-evaluat-elect,wei-2018-optim-spatio},
while others assume that different types of chargers can exist in different locations
\cite{tang-2019-robus-sched,he-2020-optim-charg}.

When considering the utility rate schedules, two key elements must be considered: the consumption cost and the demand
cost. Most approaches consider a consumption cost
\cite{jahic-2019-preem,frendo-2021-open-sourc,qin-2016-numer-analy,zhou-2020-bi-objec,duan-2021-refor-mixed,mortensen-2023-cost-minim,zhou-2020-collab-optim,rinaldi-2020-mixed-fleet}.
This is akin to the combustion engine fuel cost. Fewer works, however, consider the demand cost
\cite{jahic-2019-preem,frendo-2021-open-sourc,qin-2016-numer-analy,mortensen-2023-cost-minim,he-2020-optim-charg}.
The demand cost calculation requires a fine sampling of the power usage at any given time. Approaches that assume a full
charge whenever the bus connects typically employ a coarse sampling of charger time periods and may not be well-suited
to demand cost calculations. Furthermore, the assumption of always using fast-chargers is adverse to battery health
\cite{zhou-2020-bi-objec,millner-2010-model-lithium,edge-2021-lithium}.

To accurately calculate the demand cost, an inherent tradeoff exists between the low computation of a representative
linear model and the high computation of a high-fidelity nonlinear model. A linear, proportional model is used in this
work as they have been shown to be accurate below an 80\% threshold \cite{li-2016-batter-elect}. This is considered
sufficient for this work as charging a battery nearly to capacity is detrimental to the health and can significantly
reduce the total charge cycles a battery may undergo \cite{edge-2021-lithium,millner-2010-model-lithium}. Thus,
staying within the linear operating region is desirable for battery health.

The contributions of this work lie in the formulation of a Simulated Annealing (SA) framework that generates a charging
schedule that considers 1) Different types of chargers at the same location, 2) Minimization of the consumption and
demand utility costs, 3) Partial charging through a representative linear charge model. These contributions are
demonstrated via simulation and comparison to two other models: an implementation of the PAP for BEBs, denoted as BPAP,
and what is known as the Qin-Modified technique.

The remainder of this paper goes as follows. \ref{sec:sa-problem-description} provides the problem statement associated with
this work. \ref{sec:sa-optimization-problem} provides a description of the input parameters and decision variables then
introduces the structure of the formulation. In \ref{sec:sa-simulated-annealing}, the concept and theory of SA is introduced.
In particular, the algorithms and methods utilized for the SA implementation for this work are discussed.
\ref{sec:sa-optimization-algorithm} combines the previous sections to introduce the particular pseudocode for the SA PAP. In
\ref{sec:sa-example}, an example problem is provided to demonstrate the capability of the work provided in this paper. The
results will be presented and discussed.
\section{Problem Description}
\label{sec:sa-problem-description}
Consider a fleet of BEBs scheduled to perform a set of prescribed routes on a given day. An individual BEB from said
fleet begins and completes an individual route at the same station from which it also receives its charge. During each
route, the BEB's State of Charge (SOC) is depleted by a certain amount. The charge supplied during its visit must be
enough to sustain the BEB's SOC at an appropriate level so that it may complete its next route. Provided there is a set
of chargers at the station, the bus may be placed in any single queue to receive its charge. Let the term ``arrival''
describe the time at which a BEB reaches the station. Furthermore, let the term ``visit'' denote a BEB having arrived,
awaited its predetermined time (whether it has received a charge or not), and departed from the station. Each BEB is
allowed to have multiple visits throughout the working day.

Because each bus may visit the station more than once, let the previously considered fleet contains \(n_B\) BEBs that
collectively visit a station \(n_V\) times. At said station, let there exist a pool of \(n_Q\) charging queues from which a
visiting BEB may be assigned. Upon arrival to the station, a bus is admitted to one of the \(n_Q\) queues for charging.
Each queue represents a charger that supplies the bus with a charge at a particular rate or allows the bus to sit idle
when no charging is required (i.e., a charge rate of zero). The set of possible queue indices is denoted as \(Q \in
\{1,...,n_Q\} \subset \mathbb{Z}\), where \(\mathbb{Z}\) is the set of integers. It is assumed that charger \(q \in Q\) has an associated charge rate,
denoted as \(r_q\). Let the set of arrivals be written as \(\Iset = \{ 1, ... n_V \} \subset \mathbb{Z}\), and let each BEB be prescribed
an identification number from the set \(B = \{ 1, ..., n_B \} \subset \mathbb{Z}\). As such, each visit can be represented by the tuple:
\(\visit\), in which the elements within the tuple denote the visit index, \(i \in I\), BEB identification number, \(b \in B\),
arrival time to the station, \(a \in \mathbb{R}\), departure time from the station, \(e \in \mathbb{R}\), time at which the BEB begins charging,
\(u \in \mathbb{R}\), time at which the BEB ends charging, \(d \in \mathbb{R}\), the charger queue for the BEB to be placed into, \(q \in Q\), the SOC
upon arrival, \(\eta \in \mathbb{R}\), and the index of the next visit for the currently visiting BEB, \(\xi \in I \cup \varnothing\). The null
element, \(\varnothing\), is used to specify when a BEB has no future visits. Let the set of visits be denoted as \(\I\)
where the \(i^{\text{th}}\) visit is denoted is \(\I_i\). Furthermore, let a particular item from the tuple for visit \(i\) to
be written as \(\cdot_i\). For example, the arrival time for visit \(i\) is written as \(a_i\).

The amount of time the BEB is allowed to charge during visit \(i\) is dictated by the scheduled arrival time and required
departure time, \([a_i, e_i]\). Partial charging is allowed; however, the SOC may not exceed the BEB battery capacity,
\(\kappa_b\), and the SOC is desired to stay above some minimum percentage of the battery capacity, \(\nu_b \in [0,1]\). The battery
dynamics in this work is modeled as linear, which remains accurate up to about an SOC of 80\%
\cite{liu-2020-batter-elect}. Note that excessively charging the BEBs is undesirable due to battery health concerns as
at higher SOCs overshoot become a concern and may also cause the battery to undergo deep cycles may accelerate battery
degradation \cite{edge-2021-lithium,millner-2010-model-lithium}.

Each BEB arrival, except for the last arrival for each BEB, has a paired ``route'' that the BEB must perform after the
visit. This route, as one would expect, causes the BEB to discharge by some certain amount. Each bus route is assumed to
have a fixed discharge. Let the discharge of the route for visit \(i\) be denoted as \(\Delta_i \in \mathbb{R}\). Note that the last visit
for each BEB does not have an associated route, implying that there is no discharge after these particular visits, i.e.,
\(\Delta_i = 0\) for all \(i\) corresponding to a final visit.

\section{Optimization Problem}
\label{sec:sa-optimization-problem}
The objective of this work is to present a framework that optimizes the assignment of \(n_V\) BEB visits to a set of \(n_Q\)
charging queues over the interval \([0,\T]\) provided a fleet of \(n_A\) BEBs with fixed route schedules. Particularly, the
framework aims to minimize over peak power usage, energy consumption, encouraging battery health via slow charging, and
maintaining the SOC of each BEB above a minimum SOC threshold.

The optimization problem outlined in this work is presented in form of an objective function with constraints. The
constraints ensure that candidate solutions are operationally feasible. The variables of optimization are to be
introduced in \ref{sec:sa-parameter-definitions} followed by a discussion of the constraints in \ref{sec:sa-constraints}. The
objective function is employed to allow relative comparisons between candidate solutions and is introduced in
\ref{sec:sa-objective-function}.

\subsection{Variable Definitions}
\label{sec:sa-parameter-definitions}
This section defines the input and decision variables used in this work. The input parameters are assumed to be fixed
prior to optimizing, whereas the decision variables are the values that the SA algorithm has the freedom to manipulate.
The variables definitions used in this work are summarized in \ref{tab:sa-variables}.

\subsubsection{Input Parameters}
\label{sec:sa-input-variables}
Parameters are used to indicate values that are assumed to be known prior to optimization. They will be presented in two
sections: packing and discretization parameters then battery dynamic parameters. The spatiotemporal parameters are those
that ensure no scheduling overlap in either space or time. The discretization parameters describe the parameters that
discretize the time horizon, and the battery dynamic parameters are those associated with the SOC of the BEB.

\paragraph{Spatiotemporal and Discretization Parameters}
\label{sec:sa-packing-and-discretization-paramaters}
As previously introduced, \(\xi_i\) represents the next arrival index for bus \(b_i\). As an example of its use, suppose the
ID of each BEB is recorded in order of arrival as \(\{ 2,1,3,2 \}\). Using a starting index of 1, \(\xi_1 = 4\) as that is the
next visit by bus 2. Each visit is prescribed arrival and departure times, \(a_i\) and \(e_i\), respectively. An associated
cost is employed when a visit is assigned to a charging queue. Let the assignment cost be represented by \(\epsilon_q\). Lastly,
the time horizon is to be discretized to assist in computing the peak demand cost, let \(t_h\) denote a discrete time
step, and let \(dt\) denote the discrete time step \(dt = t_h - t_{h-1}\).

\paragraph{Battery Dynamic Parameters}
\label{sec:sa-battery-dynamic-parameters}
It is assumed that each bus begins the working day with an initial SOC percentage of \(\alpha_b\). Let the set of initial
visits by each BEB be denoted as \(\Isetinit\) where \(\Isetinit \subset \Iset\) and the cardinality of the set is \(\lvert
\Isetinit \rvert = n_B\). The initial SOC for bus \(b_i\) can be represented as \(\eta_{i} = \alpha_{b_i}\kappa_{b_i}; \forall i \in \Isetinit\)
where \(\kappa_{b_i}\) is the battery capacity for bus \(b_i\). After each arrival, the BEB is assigned to a charging queue. Let
\(r_q\) represent the power supplied from the charger in queue \(q \in Q\). Each visit, except for the final visit of each
BEB, is paired with a subsequent route to be executed with a corresponding energy requirement, \(\Delta_i\). As alluded to
earlier, there are no routes after the last visit for each BEB. Thus, similarly to the set of initial visits, let the
set of final visits for all BEBs be denoted as \(\Isetfinal\). The discharge for the final visit of each BEB is then
defined as \(\Delta_{i} = 0; \forall i \in \Isetfinal\).

\subsubsection{Decision Variables}
\label{sec:sa-decision-variables}
Decision variables are those chosen by the optimizer. There are three direct decision variables for each visit: the
initial and final charging times, \(u_i\) and \(d_i\), respectfully, and the selected charging queue, \(q_i \in \Qset\).

The remaining variables are slack variables, which are introduced to track the vehicle charge and queuing position based
on the problem parameters and direct decision variables. Recall the initial SOC for a visit is written as \(\eta_i\), where
\(i \in \Iset \setminus \Iset_0\). Further recall the set of initial visits, \(\Iset_0\), have an assumed known SOC (i.e., the initial
SOC of each BEB at the beginning of the working day is considered as an input parameter). The charge for bus \(i\)'s next
visit is equal to the initial charge for visit \(i\) plus the charge added to it by charger \(q_i\) over duration \(s_i =
d_i - u_i\) minus the discharge accumulated after visit \(i\),

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bat-chain}
  \eta_{\xi_i} = \eta_i + r_{q_i}s_i - \Delta_i\text{.}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{img/overlap}
    \caption{Examples of different methods of overlapping. Space overlap: $q_{k_1} > q_{i} + 1 \therefore \psi_{ik_{1}} = 1$.
      Time overlap $u_{k_2} < u_{j} + s_j \therefore \sigma_{k_{2}j} = 0$. Similarly, $\sigma_{k_3 i} = 0$.}
    \label{fig:overlap}
  \end{figure}

The variables \(\sigma_{ij}\) and \(\psi_{ij}\) are used to indicate whether a visit pair \((i, j)\) overlap the same space, as show
in \ref{fig:overlap}. These spatiotemporal variables uphold the following relationships: for every
visit, \(\sigma_{ij} = 1 \implies\) the start charge time of visit \(j\) is greater than the end charge time of visit \(i\).
Similarly, \(\psi_{ij} = 1 \implies\) the queue for visit \(j\) is of a greater index than visit \(i\). A value of zero for
either of these variables conveys no information.

The variable \(\C\) is the set that describes the availability for all chargers. That is, \(\C\) is a set of \(n_Q\) sets that
contain available charger times for each queue \(q \in Q\). Let a set of available charge times for queue \(q\) be defined as
\(\C_q\).

\subsection{Objective Function}
\label{sec:sa-objective-function}
This work aims to minimize the total ``cost'' of utilizing a given charge schedule. Let \(J(\I)\) represent the objective
function. The objective function for this problem has four main considerations: an assignment cost, a penalty method for
visits with insufficient SOCs, consumption cost, and a demand cost. Each of which will be discussed in turn throughout
the subsequent sections.

\subsubsection{Assignment Cost}
\label{sec:sa-assignment-cost}
The assignment cost represents the cost of assigning a bus to a queue. Particularly, the cost consists of summing a
prescribed weight for the selected charger, \(\epsilon_{q_i}\), multiplied by the charge rate, \(r_q\). Formally, the cost is
written as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:assignment-cost}
\sum_{i=1}^{n_V} \epsilon_{q_i}r_{q_i}\text{.}
\end{equation}

This is effectively the cost of selecting queue \(q_i\). While any set of weights may be selected, \ref{sec:sa-example} uses a
particular choice for the assignment cost to encourage the use of slow chargers over fast for the sake of battery
health. The charger queue indices are ordered such that the first \(n_B\) queues correspond to idle queues. This allows
all BEBs to simultaneously sit idle if needed. All \(n_B\) idle queues have assignment costs of zero to denote that there
is no cost when not charging. The next group of chargers is assumed to be the slow chargers subsequently followed by the
fast. Letting \(P \in \mathbb{R}\), then the set of slow and fast charging queues be of the form \([P, 2P, ..., n_QP]\). Concatenating
these vectors yields \(\epsilon = [0, 0, ..., P, 2P, 3P, ...]\), where \(\epsilon\) describes the vector of assignment costs and the first
\(n_B\) values are zero.

\subsubsection{Penalty Method}
\label{sec:sa-penalty-method}
A penalty method is to be implemented to provide a soft constraint on the lower bound of the charge. Due to the
uncertainty of the initial SOC for each visit, a soft constraint is desired to increase the solution space while
penalizing non-operationally feasible solutions. If a hard constraint were to be implemented, the constraint would
restrict the set of allowable schedules to only operationally feasible schedules. Let the piecewise function that
enables/disables the penalty method be of the form

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:penalty}
  \phi(x) =
  \begin{cases}
    0   & x \ge 0 \\
    x^2 & x < 0\text{.}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Letting \(x\) be defined by the difference of the initial SOC for visit \(i\), \(\eta_i\), and the minimum charge threshold,
\(\nu_{b_i}\kappa_{b_i}\), applies a penalty proportional to the difference of the SOC and the threshold squared. That is, \(x =
\eta_i - \nu_{b_i} \kappa_{b_i}\). A scalar, \(z_p\), is added which can be utilized either as a monetary conversion or a simple
gain. This method is employed as a means of encouraging that the schedule has enough charge for each BEB to complete its
next route. Therefore, the penalty method is written as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:penalty-method}
\sum_{i=1}^{n_V} z_p \phi_i(\eta_i - \nu_{b_i} \kappa_{b_i})\text{.}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Consumption Cost}
\label{sec:sa-consumpction-cost}
In most cases, utility companies have a portion of the cost related to the total electricity consumed over a billing
period, referred to herein as the consumption cost. The consumption cost is the summation of all the energy being used
over all the active periods for each charger in the time horizon. A scaling \(z_c\) is applied as a weight on the
summation (this could correspond to a monetary cost imposed by the utility). This is represented by the summation

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:consumption-cost}
z_c \sum_{i=1}^{n_V} r_{q_i}s_i\text{.}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Demand Cost}
\label{sec:sa-demand-cost}
Utility companies often charge a ``demand cost'' in an effort to reduce peak power use. A particular example of peak
demand is the fifteen minute average energy usage employed by Rocky Mountain Power Schedule 8
\cite{rocky-mountain-power}.

A method of calculating the demand charge is done by calculating the average power consumption over a given period of
time. Let the average power used over an arbitrary interval, \(T_p\), be represented by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:p}
p_{T_p}(t) = \frac{1}{T_p} \int_{t-T_p}^{t} p(\tau) d\tau\text{.}
\end{equation}

The largest average power usage over \(T_p\) is used as the demand cost for the billing period. Therefore, let the cost of
the peak power consumption be dictated by the maximum average power:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pmax}
p_{max}(t) = \max\limits_{\tau \in [0,t]}p_{T_p}(\tau)\text{.}
\end{equation}

Furthermore, a fixed minimum average power is introduced that is intended to act as a base threshold before the cost
begins to increase. Let this fixed threshold be defined as \(p_{fix}\), the demand cost is calculated using

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pdem}
p_d(t) = \max(p_{fix},p_{max}(t))\text{.}
\end{equation}

For the sake of implementation, the integral in \ref{eq:p} is discretized. Let \(dt\) denote the discretization time step and
\(p_h\) the power for the \(h^{\text{th}}\) step, \ref{eq:p} is approximated as

\begin{equation}
p_{T_p,h} = \frac{1}{T_p} \sum_{k = h-\frac{T_p}{dt}+1}^h p_k\; dt\text{.}
\end{equation}

The discrete demand cost is expressed as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pd-dis}
  p_d = \max(p_{fix}, p_{max})\text{.}
\end{equation}

Similarly to the consumption cost, a scaling \(z_d\) is applied. Again, this may be a monetary conversion or simply just a
gain.

The objective function written in its entirety is

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:objective-function}
  J(\I) = z_d p_d + \sum_{i=1}^{n_V} \Big[ \epsilon_{q_i}r_{q_i} + z_p \phi_i(\eta_i - \nu_{b_i} \kappa_{b_i}) + z_c r_{q_i} s_i \Big] \text{.}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Constraints}
\label{sec:sa-constraints}
While the objectives are used to compare solutions, constraints are introduced to ensure that the solutions are
operationally valid. Operationally validity requires that allocated BEBs do not overlap spatially or temporally.
Furthermore, the SOC of a bus at a particular visit is related to the charge from its previous visit by the amount of
charging and discharging that has occurred. Finally, buses must leave the charger before their scheduled departure time.
These constraints are represented as follows:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:constraints}

  \begin{equation}
      \label{seq:c0}
      u_j - d_i - (\sigma_{ij} - 1)T \ge 0

\end{figure}

\ref{seq:c0}-\ref{seq:c4} are denoted as ``queuing constraints''. They prevent overlap both spatially and temporally as
shown in \ref{fig:spacial-and-temporal-constr}. The y-axis represents the possible queues for a bus visit to be placed into, and the x-axis
represents the time that can be reserved for each visit. The shaded rectangles represent time that has been scheduled in
the horizontal direction, and the queue allocated for each bus visit in the vertical direction. In other words, the set
of constraints \ref{seq:c0} - \ref{seq:c4} aim to ensure that these shaded rectangles never overlap.

Constraint \ref{seq:c0} states that the starting charge time for BEB \(u_j\) must begin after the previous BEB departs,
\(d_i\). A value of \(\sigma_{ij} = 1 \implies\) bus \(i\) has detached from the charger before bus \(j\) has begun charging. If
\(\sigma_{ij} = 0\), then the constraint is of the form \(\T + d_i > u_j\) rendering the constraint ``inactive''. Similarly, for
\ref{seq:c1}, \(\psi_{ij}\) determines spacial positioning of BEB \(i\) and \(j\) relative to one another. A value of \(\psi_{ij} = 1
\implies\) BEB \(i\) is in a queue index that is less than BEB \(j\). If \(\psi_{ij} = 0\) then the constraint is deactivated.
Constraints \ref{seq:c2} - \ref{seq:c4} enforce spatial and temporal ordering between each queue/vehicle pair.
\ref{seq:c2} and \ref{seq:c3} ensure that BEB \(i\) is not placed before and after \(j\) spatially or temporally as that is
not possible. \ref{seq:c4} enforces at least one of the spatial or temporal relationships between each visit is active.
This ensures there are no scheduling conflicts (i.e. either charging sessions are ordered temporally or are in different
queues).

\ref{seq:c5} describes the service time of the bus. \ref{seq:c6} calculates the initial charge for the next visit for
bus \(b_i\). \ref{seq:c7} ensures that the bus is not being over-charged. \ref{seq:c8} ensures the continuity of the times
(i.e. the arrival time is less than the initial charge which is less than the detach time which is less than the time
the bus exits the station and all must be less than the time horizon).
\section{Simulated Annealing}
\label{sec:sa-simulated-annealing}
SA is a well-studied local search metaheuristic used to solve various optimization problems
\cite{gendreau-2018-handb-metah,press-1992-numer-recip}. The algorithm is often applied to problems that contain many
local solutions as it employs a stochastic approach that explores the solution space for an approximate global optimum.
This model is named after its analogized process where a crystalline solid is heated then allowed to cool at a slow rate
until it achieves its most regular possible crystal lattice configuration (i.e. lowest energy state)
\cite{henderson-1989-theor-pract,press-1992-numer-recip}. SA establishes a connection between the thermodynamic
process and the search for global optimum in optimization problems. Within the SA process there are three key
components: cooling equation, acceptance criteria, and generation mechanisms
\cite{keller-2019-multi-objec,press-1992-numer-recip}.

The cooling equation describes the speed at which the figurative temperature is decreased in a controlled manner over
time. Throughout the SA process, many ``candidate'' solutions are generated and compared to an ``active'' solution. The
method by which the solutions are accepted is determined by the acceptance criteria. The acceptance criteria is a
function of the system temperature that makes the decision whether the system will accept an inferior solution in favor
of exploring the solution space. The means by which candidate solutions are generated is via the generation mechanisms.
These generators modify the solution by some singular discrete change \cite{gendreau-2018-handb-metah}. Each of these
components are elaborated in the subsequent sections.

\subsection{Cooling Equation}
\label{cooling-equation-experimental}
The cooling equation models the rate at which the temperature decreases over time in the SA process. Initially, when the
temperature is high, SA encourages exploration. As the process begins to ``cool down'' (in accordance to the cooling
schedule), it begins to encourage local exploitation of the solution (rather than exploration)
\cite{rutenbar-1989-simul-anneal-algor,henderson-1989-theor-pract}. There are three common basic types of cooling
equations: linear, geometric, and exponential. Geometric cooling schedules are most widely used in practice
\cite{keller-2019-multi-objec}. As such, it will also be employed by this work. It is defined by the difference
equation

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cool}
t_m = \beta t_{m-1}\text{.}
\end{equation}

In \ref{eq:cool}, \(\beta\) controls the cooling rate. Typical values of \(\beta\) are within the range \([0.8, 0.99]\)
\cite{henderson-1989-theor-pract}. \ref{fig:geometric} demonstrates this principle by plotting the geometric schedule
using varying values of \(\beta\). The variable \(t_m\) represents the temperature at the \(m^{\text{th}}\) step of the
temperature function. The total amount of steps, \(M\), is dictated by the initial temperature and \(\beta\).

\begin{figure}[t!]
  \centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{img/geometric.png}
  \caption{Geometric cooling schedule utilizing various value of $\beta$.}
  \label{fig:geometric}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Acceptance Criteria}
\label{sec:sa-acceptance}
In SA, the algorithm stores a solution that is continuously compared to newly generated solutions. Let the stored
solution be referred to as the ``active solution''. During each iteration, a new ``candidate'' solution is generated and
compared to the active solution to determine if the candidate solution should replace the active solution. The method of
determining whether the active solution should be replaced is defined by an acceptance criteria. In an effort to
encourage exploration, inferior candidate solutions have a probability of being accepted. The probability of accepting
an inferior candidate solution is determined by the objective functions of the active and candidate solutions, \(J(\I)\)
and \(J(\bar{\I})\), respectively, and the current temperature, \(t_m\). Let \(\Delta E \equiv J(\I) - J(\bar{\I})\) and let \(f(\cdot)\) be
the function that describes the probability of accepting a candidate solution \(\bar{\I}\). The probability of accepting a
candidate solution is thus of the form \cite{keller-2019-multi-objec}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:candaccept}
f(\I,\bar{\I},t_m) =
\begin{cases}
  1                   & \Delta E > 0 \\
  e^{- \frac{\Delta E}{t_m}} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\text{.}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Neighbor Generators and Wrappers}
\label{sec:sa-generation-mechanisms}
Generation mechanisms are used to create a neighboring candidate solution \cite{gendreau-2018-handb-metah}. That is,
the generating function creates a solution that can be reached in a single iteration from the active solution. In
response to the problem statement made in \ref{sec:sa-problem-description}, five primitive generation mechanism are used: new
visit, slide visit, new charger, wait, and new window. The purpose of each of these generators is to assign new visits
to a charger, adjust a bus visits initial and final charge time within the same time frame/queue, move a BEB from one
charger to another with the same charge schedule, move a bus to its idle queue. Each generator will be discussed in more
detail in \ref{sec:sa-generators}.

These primitive generation mechanisms will, in turn, be utilized by two wrapper functions. The charge schedule generator
is to used create an initial candidate solutions for SA and the perturb schedule generator is used to take a candidate
solution and alter it slightly in an attempt to step toward a global or local minimum. The wrapper functions will be
discussed in \ref{sec:sa-generator-wrappers}. However, prior to discussing the primitives and wrapper generating functions,
their respective inputs and outputs must be defined.

\subsubsection{Generator Input/Output}
\label{sec:sa-generator-input-output}
Each generator primitive accepts a tuple \(\Sol \equiv (i, \I, \C)\) where \(i\) is the visit index being manipulated, \(\I\) is
the set of visits, and \(\C\) is the set that describes the availability for all chargers \(q \in \Qset\). The output of the
generating functions is the same as the input, but with changes applied to it by a generator. Let a modified variable be
denoted with a bar, \(\bar{\cdot}\). Thus, the modified input tuple is written as \(\bar{\Sol}\).

\subsubsection{Generators}
\label{sec:sa-generators}
The mechanism by which candidate solutions are generated is introduced in the subsequent sections. Recall that to
satisfy constraints, \(n_B\) extra idle queues are added that provide no power to the BEB. Because of this, the set of
queues is fully defined where \(Q\) is the ordered set of idle queues, slow queues, then fast queue. The use case for the
idle queues are for when a bus is not to be placed on a charger. Rather, it will be placed in the queue, \(q \in B\), which
satisfies the previously defined spatial constraints while allowing the bus to be ``set aside''. The charge queues are
denoted by \(q \in \{1, ..., n_B , n_B + 1, ..., n_Q\}\).

For the sake of ease in referring to the various variables associated with a visit, dot notation is used. For example,
suppose the arrival time is desired to be extracted from visit \(i\). Given \(\I\), the notation that describes extracting
the initial charge time for visit \(i\) is written as \(u_i \equiv \I_{i.u}\).

\paragraph{New visit}
\label{sec:sa-new-visit}
The new visit generator defined in \ref{alg:new-visit} describes the process of moving a BEB, \(b \in B\), from a waiting
queue, \(q \in B\), to a charging queue, \(q_i \in \{n_B + 1, ..., n_Q\}\), within its arrival/departure time \([a_i, e_i]\). Let
\(\U_{\{\cdot\}}\) indicate that an element is selected randomly with a uniform distribution from the set \(\{\cdot\}\). For
example, \(\U_{[a_i, e_i]}\) indicates that a value will be selected between \(a\) and \(e\) with a uniform distribution.
\ref{alg:new-visit} begins by extracting variables. Lines 8 and 9 randomly select a charging queue and available time
frame with a uniform distribution, respectively. Line 10 attempts to assign the visit to the previously select time
slice, if it succeeds, the updated visit is returned. Otherwise, the null value is returned.

The function \texttt{FindFreeTime} is the algorithm that determines whether a visit's time at the station \([a_i, e_i]\) can be placed
in the time availability of charger \(q\). Let the available time for charger \(q\) for visit \(i\) be denoted as \(C \equiv
\C_{i.q}\). Furthermore, let the lower and upper bound of \(\C\) be denoted as \(C_L\) and \(C_U\), respectively. The algorithm
checks whether the BEB time at the station, \([a_i, e_i]\) fits within the charger availability \([C_L, C_U]\). If it does,
a random charging time frame is returned such that \(a_i \le u_i \le d_i \le e_i\). Otherwise the null value is returned.

    }
\end{algorithm}

\paragraph{Slide visit}
\label{slide-visit}
This primitive generator is used for visits that have already been scheduled. Because of the constraint \ref{seq:c8},
there may be some slack to manipulate \([u_i, d_i]\) within the window \([a_i, e_i]\). That is, two new values, \(u_i\) and
\(d_i\) are randomly selected with a uniform distribution that satisfy the constraint \(a_i \leq u_i \leq d_i \leq e_i\).
\ref{alg:slide-visit} begins be extracting variables. Line 5 purges the visit from the charger availability schedule.
The \texttt{Purge} function simply removes an assigned charge time from the set \(\C\). Without altering selected queue, the charge
time randomly re-assigned with a uniform distribution. Upon success, the updated tuple is returned, otherwise the null
value is returned.

        \Return{($\varnothing$)}\tcc*{Return nothing}
    }
  \end{algorithm}

\paragraph{New charger}
\label{new-charger}
The new charger generator moves a visit \(\I_i\) to a new charging queue while maintaining the same charge time, \([u_i,
d_i]\). \ref{alg:new-charger} begins be extracting variables, and then purges the visit from the charger availability
set, a queue is selected at random with a uniform distribution, then the new selection is checked whether the charge
time \([u_i, d_i]\) may be assigned to the new queue.

      \Return{($\varnothing$)}\tcc*{Return nothing}
    }
  \end{algorithm}

\paragraph{Wait}
\label{sec:sa-wait}
The wait generator simply removes a bus from a charger queue and places it in its idle queue, \(q_i \in B\). \ref{alg:wait}
begins by purging the visit from the charger availability set, the visit is then assigned to its idle queue for the
duration of its time at the station.

    }
  \end{algorithm}

\paragraph{New Window}
\label{sec:sa-new-window}
New window, as shown in \ref{alg:new-window}, is a combination of \ref{alg:new-visit} (new visit) and \ref{alg:wait}
(wait). By this it is meant that visit \(i\) is placed in its wait queue then added back in as if it were a new visit.
This implies that the BEB may be assigned to a different queue with a new charging time frame. Upon success, the
algorithm returns the updated tuple, otherwise return the null value.

  }
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Generator Wrappers}
\label{sec:sa-generator-wrappers}
The generator wrappers provide the highest level of abstraction from which the SA algorithm directly interacts. These
wrapper functions utilize the primitive generators previously described to either create a new charge schedule to
initialize the SA algorithm, or to modify an existing schedule.

\paragraph{Charge Schedule Generation}
\label{sec:sa-charge-schedule-generation}
The objective of \ref{alg:charge-schedule-generation} is to introduce a method that provides the SA algorithm with an
initial charging schedule. The schedule generation is chosen to initialize the algorithm in a greedy manner by looping
through each visit and executing \ref{alg:new-visit} to place visit \(i\) at random queue with a random charge time.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\scriptsize

    \Begin
    {
        \tcc{Select an unscheduled BEB visit from a randomly indexed set of visits}
        \ForEach {$\I_i \in \I$}
        {
            ($i, \bar{\I}$, $\bar{\C}$) $\leftarrow$ \NewVisit{($\I_i$, $\I$, $\C$)}\tcc*{Assign the bus to a charger}
        }
            \Return{($\bar{\I}$, $\bar{\C}$)}
    }
  \end{algorithm}

\paragraph{Perturb Schedule}
\label{sec:sa-tweak-schedule}
\ref{alg:perturb-schedule} describes the method by which the SA algorithm decides how to perturb a given charge
schedule. The method that will be employed to generate neighboring solutions is as follows: pick a visit, pick a
primitive generator, and execute said primitive generator once. Let \(\W^y_{[\cdot]}\) denote a random selection with a
distribution specified by a weight vector \(y \in \mathbb{R}\). Thus, \ref{alg:perturb-schedule} is as follows: Lines 2-12 generate a
vector of weights for the visit index selection. The weights have a default value of one. Each visit is then indexed in
reverse order. If the SOC of the visit is less than \(\nu_b \kappa_b\), then the weight for the visit is calculated as shown on
Line 10. The route for BEB \(b\) is then set as a ``priority'' on Line 9 to propagate the previously calculated weight to
earlier visits of BEB \(b\) as shown on Line 5. This is done in an attempt to encourage the SA algorithm to ``fix'' the
current or previous visits so that the SOC stays above the minimum threshold. The algorithm then selects a visit index
with weighted distribution \(y^v\) and selects a primitive with a weighted distribution, \(y^p\). Letting \(n_G\) denote the
number of primitive generating functions, line 15 selects a primitive generating function with a weighted distribution,
\(\W^{y^v}_{[1, n_G]}\). The primitive is then executed, and the results are returned.

        \Return{($\bar{\I}$, $\bar{\C}$)}
    }
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Alternative Heuristic Implementation}
\label{sec:sa-heuristic-implementation}
As suggested by the works in \cite{Zhang_2010,Xinchao_2011}, applying heuristics to the generating functions can
manipulate the searched neighborhoods in a way that may assist the SA algorithm with convergence. As a test to assist in
minimizing charger utilization, a simple heuristic is applied to \ref{alg:new-visit} and \ref{alg:new-charger} in the
method that they select new charging queues. Rather than selecting a queue at random from \(q \in Q\), the algorithms
randomly select whether to place a BEB in a slow or fast charging queue with a weighted distribution favoring slow
chargers. Once the charger type has been selected, the algorithm will then begin incrementally attempting to place the
BEB in a queue of that type beginning from the smallest index of that charger type. For example, if a BEB has been
selected to be placed in a queue with a slow charger, the algorithm begins by attempting to place the BEB in the charger
queue \(q = n_B + 1\). If it is unable to be placed in that queue, it then attempts to be placed in the next queue \(q =
n_B + 2\). This is done incrementally until all the queues have been exhausted. The objective of this alternative
approach is to explore whether the added up-front computation cost by including the heuristic will positively influence
the output of the results and to what degree.
\section{Optimization Algorithm}
\label{sec:sa-optimization-algorithm}
This section combines the generation algorithms and the optimization problem into a single algorithm (\ref{alg:sa-pap}).
Generally, SA assumes that the generated candidate solutions are within the solution space of the problem, \(\Sol \in S\)
where \(S\) is the solution space. In other words, the initialization and perturbations of a schedule must be verified to
ensure that the generated schedule is in the solution space. Therefore, the objective function and constraints
introduced in \ref{sec:sa-constraints} and \ref{sec:sa-objective-function}, respectively, must be employed to verify that the
outputs of \ref{alg:charge-schedule-generation} and \ref{alg:perturb-schedule} are in the feasible space, \(S\).

As previously stated, the generating functions directly influence the values of the assigned charge queue, charge
initialization time, and charge completion time: \(q_i\), \(u_i\), and \(d_i\), respectively. Having generated those values,
the rest of the decision variables may be derived. Beginning with the packing constraints, \ref{seq:c0}-\ref{seq:c1} are
employed to enable and disable \(\sigma_{ij}\) and \(\psi_{ij}\) and \ref{seq:c2}-\ref{seq:c4} ensure the validity of the values.
\ref{seq:c5} can be directly calculated and \ref{seq:c8} is fully defined.

Changing the focus over to the dynamic constraints, similarly to what was seen with the packing constraints, the battery
dynamic constraints are also fully defined. \ref{seq:c6} is sequentially calculated after a given schedule has been
created. \ref{seq:c7} is evaluated to ensure the BEB is not overcharged. The penalty method implemented in
\ref{sec:sa-objective-function} is set in place to allow the SOC to go below the specified threshold, \(\nu_{b_i} \kappa_{b_i}\), but
punish the solution for doing so. Thus, over time, the candidate solutions will be encouraged toward a solution that
does not activate the penalty method (i.e., is solution is operationally feasible).

The implementation of the SA PAP, outlined in \ref{alg:sa-pap}, will now be discussed. The algorithm begins by creating
a temperature schedule and creating an initial solution. The algorithm then iterates through the temperature schedule
(outer loop). For each iteration of the outer loop, an inner loop is executed \(n_K\) times. During this inner loop, the
solution is modified by a primitive generating function to create a candidate solution. The candidate is solution is
then compared with the active solution, and updated according to the acceptance criteria. These actions are performed
until the cooling equation is exhausted.

\section{Example}
\label{sec:sa-example}
An example is now provided to demonstrate the utility of the developed SA charge scheduling technique. In
\ref{sec:sa-beb-scenario} a description of the example scenario is presented followed by a brief introduction of the BEB
implementation of the PAP (BPAP) and an alternative threshold based strategy called the Qin-Modified technique.
\ref{sec:sa-results} presents the results for each of planning strategies. The results are then analyzed and discussed.

\subsection{BEB Scenario}
\label{sec:sa-beb-scenario}
The test scenario was run over a time horizon of \(T=24\) hours, with a total of \(n_V = \N\) visits to the station shared
between \(n_B = \A\) buses. Each BEB is assumed to have a battery capacity of \(\kappa_b =\) \batsize kWh that is required to
stay above an SOC of \(\nu_b =\) \mincharge (\num{\fpeval{\batsize * \minchargeD}} kWh). Each bus is assumed to
begin the working day with \(\alpha =\) \num{\fpeval{\acharge*100}}\% charge (\num{\fpeval{\acharge * \batsize}} kWh). A total of \num{\fpeval{\fast + \slow}} chargers are utilized where \slow of the chargers
are slow charging (\slows kW) and \fast are fast charging (\fasts kW). The gains of \(z_p =\) \num{\Cgain},
\(z_c = 1\), and \(z_d =\) \num{10000} are used. As previously introduced, to encourage slow charging for battery
health, the values of \(\epsilon\) in the objective function are \(\forall q \in \{1,2,..., n_B \}; \epsilon_q = 0\) and \(\forall q \in \{n_B + 1, n_B +
2, ..., n_Q\}; \epsilon_q = 10q\). The SA algorithm utilizes the geometric cooling schedule with an initial temperature of \(T_0
=\) \num{\tempinit} with \(\beta = 0.997\), resulting in a total of \(n_M =\) \num{\tempcnt} steps. Rocky
Mountain Power utilizes fifteen-minute intervals to calculate the demand cost \cite{rocky-mountain-power}. To match the
method by which Rocky Mountain Power determines its demand cost, this work employed an interval of \(T_p =\)
\num{\fpeval{15*60}} seconds in its demand cost calculation. A weight vector of \([0.6255, 0.6255, 0.4170,
0.2085]\) is used to influence the distribution of selecting the new charger, new window, wait, and slide visit
primitives, respectively. The algorithm also assumes a total of \(n_K = \localcnt\) iterations for the local search at a
constant temperature. In total, that results in \num{\fpeval{\localcnt * \tempcnt}} configurations being
searched in a total runtime of \num{\fpeval{\quicklocal * \tempcnt}} seconds.

\ref{sec:sa-heuristic-implementation} introduced the idea of an alternative heuristic implementation for the SA algorithm. To
distinguish the heuristic implementation from the method derived in \ref{sec:sa-generation-mechanisms}, let this
implementation be referred to as ``heuristic'' implementation and the previous as the ``quick'' implementation due to the
fact that it is designed to execute more quickly. Using the same weights for randomly selecting the primitive
generators, the heuristic approach further implemented a weighted distribution vector of \([0.9487, 0.3162]\) to decide
whether to select a slow or fast charger, respectively. The heuristic approach had a total runtime of
\num{\fpeval{\heuristiclocal * \tempcnt}} seconds. The heuristic generators were expected to be slightly
slower due to its iterative approach.

The Qin-Modified is a threshold-based strategy that is also employed as a means of comparison with the results of the SA
BPAP. The Qin-Modified algorithm is a based on the threshold strategy of \cite{qin-2016-numer-analy}. The algorithm has
been modified slightly to accommodate the case of multiple charger types without a heuristic search for the best charger
type. The heuristic is based on a set of rules that revolve around the initial charge of the bus at visit \(i\). There are
three different thresholds, low (60\%), medium (70\%), and high (90\%). Buses below the low threshold are prioritized to
fast chargers then are allowed to utilize slow chargers if no fast chargers are available. Buses between the low and
medium threshold prioritize slow chargers first and utilize fast chargers only if no slow chargers are available. Buses
above the medium threshold and below high will only be assigned to slow chargers. Buses above the high threshold will
not be charged. Once a bus has been assigned to a charger, it remains on the charger for the duration of the time it is
at the station, or it reaches 90\% charge, whichever comes first.

Another method utilized to compare with against SA PAP is the BEB implementation of the PAP. The BPAP implementation is
utilized in this work as a benchmark for the other schedules as it is implemented utilizing a commercial solver. The
inputs to the system are the same as those discussed above. It is of note that the BPAP does not implement the demand
cost in its objective function. In an attempt to compare the solution of the BPAP with the SA output more directly, a
similar solve time of 1,900 seconds is utilized. The BPAP was executed using the Gurobi MILP solver
\cite{gurobi-2021-gurob-optim}. The previously described simulations were run on a machine equipped with an AMD Ryzen 9
5900X 12 - Processor (24 core) at 4.95GHz.

\subsection{Results}
\label{sec:sa-results}
The schedules generated by each of the methods is presented in \ref{fig:schedule}. For the sake of conciseness of the
schedule plots, the waiting queues are excluded. Therefore, rows 0-14 represent slow charging queues and rows 15-29
represent fast charging queues. The hollow circles with an 'X' represent the initial charge times, and the horizontal
line with the vertical tick signifies the region of time the charger is active. The Qin-Modified schedule utilized two
fast chargers and fourteen slow chargers as can be seen in \ref{subfig:schedule-qin}. The BPAP framework generated a
schedule that utilizes three fast charges and four slow chargers as shown in \ref{subfig:schedule-milp}. The heuristic
SA strategy created a schedule with nine slow charger queues and one fast charging queue as shown in
\ref{subfig:schedule-heuristic-sa}. The quick strategy for the SA algorithm created a schedule utilizing seven slow
chargers and two fast chargers as is demonstrated in \ref{subfig:schedule-quick-sa}. That is to say, while each schedule
emphasized the utilization of slow chargers, the Qin-Modified required fast charging most frequently followed by the
BPAP, quick SA, and then heuristic SA. At the expense of incorporating more slow chargers than the BPAP, the SA
techniques chose to utilize fast chargers less frequently in their respective schedules showing an emphasis on battery
health.

\ref{tab:charge} tabulates the mean, minimum, and maximum SOC upon arrival for each visit. The BPAP requires each BEB to stay
above an SOC of 25\% while the quick and heuristic SA approaches heavily penalize a schedule for allowing a BEB to go
below the 25\% SOC threshold. The BPAP was able to successfully keep the SOC above the threshold while both SA approaches
were a few kWh below the threshold. The SOC of the quick SA approach dropped to a minimum of 94.760 kWh and the
heuristic had a minimum SOC of 91.265 kWh as shown in \ref{tab:charge}. Due to the threshold constraint being soft, the SA
objective function may find it better to allow a small deficit in the threshold penalty function in favor of another
action. As a remedy to ensure the SA schedules stays above the threshold, a safety factor could be introduced to
artificially increase the threshold, \(S_f \nu_{b_i}\kappa_{b_i}\) where \(S_f > 1;\; S_f \in \mathbb{R}\).

The Qin-Modified schedule allowed the SOC for one of the BEBs to reach 0\% as shown in \ref{tab:charge}. The Qin-Modified
strategy, being a purely reactive model, does not have foresight to determine whether a set of routes has a particularly
taxing route later in the time horizon. As such, and in the case of the example scenario, the BEB that reached a charge
of 0\% began with a sequence of short routes, much like the other BEBs. However, rather than continuing this trend, these
sets of routes had one or two longer routes which the Qin-Modified algorithm was unable to account for. Interestingly,
Qin-Modified strategy was able to keep the mean SOC the highest followed by the quick SA, heuristic SA, and then the
BPAP.

\begin{table}[htbp]

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\ref{fig:power} depicts the power utilized over the time horizon for each model. Referencing
\ref{fig:power-usage-milp-qin}, the Qin maintained long periods of steady slow and fast charger use. This is again a
symptom of the Qin-Modified strategy placing BEBs on chargers based solely on the SOC upon arrival. The BPAP and SA
techniques, having demand peaks in the first half of the time horizon, were able to effectively maintain lower demand
profiles during slower moments throughout the day (the SA techniques more so than the BPAP). \ref{fig:power} is also of
interest as it shows the peak power demand over the time horizon. The peaks for each schedule shown in \ref{tab:power}.
Both the quick and heuristic SA techniques were able to maintain peak power use below 1,130 kW whereas the BPAP and Qin
had peaks above 1,900 kW demonstrating significant demand cost reduction.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{\label{tab:power}Table of mean and max power demand for each charging schedule.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|cccc}
\hline
 & BPAP & Qin-Modified & Heuristic & Quick\\[0pt]

Mean & 176.550 & 394.130 & 180.858 & 186.858\\[0pt]
Max & 1,910.000 & 2,000.000 & 1,150.950 & 1,120.950\\[0pt]
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The total energy consumed by each schedule is shown in \ref{fig:energy-usage}. The ordering of most energy consumed to
least is as follows: Qin-Modified, quick SA, heuristic SA, and the BPAP. The respective energy consumption for each
technique is: 9,459.120 kWh, 4,428.670 kWh, 4,295.660 kWh, and 4,237.200 kWh. The heuristic SA consuming about
\num{\fpeval{4295.7 - 4237.2}} kWh more than the BPAP. While the quick and heuristic SA were slightly above
the BPAP in energy consumption, it is a trade-off made by increasing the number of slow chargers and charge duration,
and reducing the peak demand. Referencing \ref{tab:charge} and \ref{tab:power} for the mean SOC and mean demand, respectively,
the descending order of consumed energy is correlated to the descending order of the mean SOC and the descending order
of the mean power demand. This makes sense as a higher mean SOC implies the chargers being active more often; similarly
for the mean demand.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{\label{tab:scores}Table of objective function scores for each of the schedules.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|c}
\hline
Schedule & Score\\[0pt]
\hline
BPAP & \num{18500000}\\[0pt]
Qin-Modified & \num{34578526}\\[0pt]
Heuristic & \num{11673937}\\[0pt]
Quick & \num{11234577}\\[0pt]
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

As a final comparison, the scores for the Qin-Modified, quick SA, BPAP, and heuristic SA are shown in \ref{tab:scores}. The
Qin-Modified strategy naturally has the highest score as it performed the worst in each metric of the objective
function. Although the BPAP was able to maintain the SOC of each BEB above the minimum charge threshold, due to large
peaks in the power demand in the BPAP schedule, both SA techniques were able to achieve lower scores. In other words,
although the SA techniques allowed small breaches in the minimum SOC, the objective function found the quick and
heuristic SA schedule configurations to be more desirable than that of the BPAP. The quick SA was able to successfully
obtain the lowest score due to its substantial reduction in the demand cost and its smaller breach of the minimum SOC
threshold.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:sa-conclusion}
This work developed an SA implementation of the BEB charge scheduling problem derived from the works of the Position
Allocation Problem \cite{qarebagh-2019-optim-sched}. The model is designed to encourage the use of slow chargers for
battery health, minimize the peak energy consumption, and minimize the total energy consumed. The problem description
was provided outlining the scenario in which this model is designed for. The optimization problem was then introduced by
describing the components of the objective function and outlining the constraints utilized to ensure candidate solutions
are in the solution space.

An example of the SA PAP algorithm was presented and compared against the BPAP, which acted as a baseline for the other
schedule. Another threshold-based strategy called the Qin-Modified technique was also introduced as a means of comparing
the schedules. The SA PAP was run utilizing two different neighborhood searching techniques named the ``quick'' and
``heuristic'' techniques, respectively. The quick SA's objective was to randomly search a wide neighborhood while the
heuristic technique was designed to incrementally search a neighborhood by randomly selecting a fast or slow charging
queue and then stepping through the queues one at a time. The execution time compounds as the number of iterations in
the cooling function increases as shown by the respective quick and heuristic execution times:
\num{\fpeval{\quicklocal * \tempcnt}} seconds and \num{\fpeval{\heuristiclocal * \tempcnt}}
seconds. The Qin-Modified strategy favored the use of fast chargers due to its inability to identify when demanding
routes were on the horizon, whereas the other methods used fast charges sparingly. Particularly, the SA techniques
favored higher number of slow chargers with longer charge durations in comparison to the BPAP.

Both of the SA techniques were unable to keep the SOC above the 25\% SOC threshold with SOC falling to 91.265. kWh for
the heuristic SA and 94.760 kWh for the quick SA. Due to the minimum charge threshold being a soft constraint for the
SA, the algorithm found another actions to be more favorable at the expense of moderately breaching the threshold. The
Qin-Modified, on the other hand, had the SOC of one BEB fall to 0\% SOC. The schedule that consumed the least amount of
energy is the BPAP (4,237.2 kWh) followed by the heuristic SA (4,295.6 kWh). The difference between the two being about
\num{\fpeval{4295.6 - 4237.2}} kWh. The quick SA energy consumption came in a close third at 4,428.7 kWh. Both
the quick and SA techniques were able to significantly reduce the peak power demand having peaks below 1,200 kW. The
BPAP and Qin both had peak power demands above 1,800 kW. The best scoring schedule was the quick SA due to its
significant reduction in demand cost, similar energy consumption as the heuristic SA and BPAP, and its small minimum SOC
threshold deficit.

Further fields of interest are to investigate the performance of the quick and heuristic SA approaches utilizing a
denser set of routes, constraints that encourage tighter temporal packing, combining the heuristic and quick SA
techniques, or applying a similar weighting scheme from the heuristic on the quick SA. It is also of interest to
incorporate non-linear battery dynamics model to the SOC with more fidelity. Furthermore, ``fuzzifying'' the charge times
is of interest to allow flexibility in the initial and final charge times for each BEB visit.
