This document outlines a Simulated Annealing (SA) approach to the bus charging scheduling problem that utilizes Mixed
Integer Linear Programming (MILP) constraints to determine feasible charging schedules. The problem involves generating
an optimal charging schedule for a fleet of Battery Electric Buses (BEBs) based on a set of routes and a mix of fast and
slow chargers. The aim is to minimize both the consumption cost (amount of electricity used over a certain time) and the
demand cost (rate at which electricity is being used) while ensuring that the buses maintain sufficient charge to
complete their workday without delays.

The SA algorithm is introduced and constrained by a set of MILP constraints derived from the Position Allocation Problem
(PAP) to ensure the validity of proposed charging schedules. Objective functions describing consumption cost and demand
cost are used to minimize power consumption and total cost of using the BEBs.

It is assumed that each visit occurs within the planning time horizon $T = \{t : t_0 \le t \le t_f \}$. The concept of
"arrivals" is derived from the PAP [cite:@qarebagh-2019-optim-sched]. The notion of a visit is useful in the sense that
it provides simple mechanism to describe the state of any arbitrary BEB at the time of arrival; however, a BEB may visit
the station multiple times. The issue arises due to model's assumption that each arrival is unique (i.e. no single BEB
arrives more than once). Therefore, a system must be put in place to track each BEB across visits.

To explore the feasible space, the generators are employed with a sense of randomness to their respective outputs.
Because of that, the modified subset of the tuple, $\bar{x}_i$, may be considered a random variable. Let the set of
states for the output be defined as $\bar{x}_i \in \bar{x}_i \subset \bar{\Sol}$ where $\bar{x}_i$ defines the feasible region
for the subset of decision variables.

Public transportation systems are crucial in any urban area; however, the increased awareness and concern of
environmental impacts of petroleum based public transportation has driven an effort to reduce the pollutant footprint
[cite:@de-2014-simul-elect;@xylia-2018-role-charg;@guida-2017-zeeus-repor-europ;@li-2016-batter-elect]. Particularly,
the electrification of public bus transportation via battery power, i.e., battery electric buses (BEBs), has received
significant attention [cite:@li-2016-batter-elect]. Although the technology provides benefits beyond reduction in
emissions, such as lower driving costs, lower maintenance costs, and reduced vehicle noise, battery powered systems
introduce new challenges such as larger upfront costs, and potentially several hours long "refueling" periods
[cite:@xylia-2018-role-charg;@li-2016-batter-elect]. Furthermore, the problem is exacerbated by the constraints of the
transit schedule to which the fleet must adhere, the limited amount of chargers available, and the adverse affects in
the health of the battery due to fast charging [cite:@lutsey-2019-updat-elect].

BEBs have been in service for many major markets, North America, Europe, and China, for more than a decade with expected
growth in the near future [cite:@deng-2021-survey-elect]. The Asia Pacific market is forecasted to dominate the sales
and some major companies of the industry have also begun to enter the global market such as Volvo, BYD, and Proterra by
2025 [cite:@deng-2021-survey-elect]. Much focus has been placed on the engineering of individual BEBs such as battery
type, brake regenerative charging, optimal battery charging, and battery degradation [cite:@chen-2008-desig-grey;
@abdollahi-2016-optim-batter;@kuhne-2010-elect;@deng-2021-survey-elect]. The interest of route scheduling, charging
fleets, and optimizing the infrastructure are problems of more recent interest and are therefore timely and increasingly
relevant problems as EV/BEBs become more commonplace [cite:@hoke-2014-accoun-lithium; @sebastiani-2016-evaluat-elect;
@wei-2018-optim-spatio].

The literature shows an interest in solving the problem of assigning BEBs to charging queues or optimizing their
infrastructure [cite:@wei-2018-optim-spatio;@sebastiani-2016-evaluat-elect;
@hoke-2014-accoun-lithium;@wang-2017-elect-vehic]. In fact, many works attempt to solve both problems simultanously
barring some simplification whether it be only allowing chargers of a single type
[cite:@he-2020-optim-charg;@tang-2019-robus-sched]. If multiple chargers are used, then one of each type is assigned at
each location. Others have also assumed that a BEB shall recieve full charge upon each arrival
[cite:@wei-2018-optim-spatio;@wang-2017-elect-vehic;@zhou-2020-bi-objec;@wang-2017-optim-rechar]. Some works on the
stochastic effects of energy consumption while on route for a BEB as well as trip times [cite:@zhou-2020-collab-optim;
@bie-2021-optim-elect]. One other source, as far as the reseach for this work has shown, describes a method of producing
a BEB charge schedule wih a high fidelity while accounting for multiple charger times as well as being able to minimize
over the total charger count [cite:@whitaker-2023-a-network].

The work described in this proposal is similar to the work in [cite:@whitaker-2023-a-network]; however provides an
alternate method of modeling the problem in what is known as the Position Allocation Problem (PAP). The PAP is modeled
after the Berth Allocation Problem (BAP), which was designed to optimally schedule cargo vessels to be berthed and
serviced [cite:@buhrkal-2011-model-discr; @imai-2001-dynam-berth; @frojan-2015-contin-berth;]. The PAP utilizes this
notion to develop a model of assigning EVs to queue in ordered to be charged [cite:@qarebagh-2019-optim-sched].

Because of the PAP's extremely close modeling methods to the BAP, literature from the BAP can (and will) provide support
for the development of the PAP in this work. The BAP has been studied in literature since the 1990s and provides a depth
of work to derive from [cite:@rodrigues-2022-berth]. The proposed work also intends to introduce a sense of robustness
by allowing uncertainty in the arrival times of the BEBs. By "fuzzifying" the model, the "fuzzy" variables are allowed
to have upper and lower bounds for which the model can provide solutions for. The work to be introduced promises much
potential for further research and development in regard to scheduling BEBs. What follows is a proposal for a Simulated
Annealing (SA) implementation and extension of the PAP utilizing Fully Fuzzy Mixed Integer Linear Programming (FFMILP)
constraints with non-linear battery dynamics.

In the next section, a review of relevant literature of BEBs is introduced and discussed. Background and a problem
statement will be elaborated further to provide context and a required basis of understanding prior to discussing the
objectives and approaches in [[#sec:objectives]] and [[#sec:approach]], respectively. The BEB queue scheduling problem discussed
throughout this section is of particular interest at this time in the BEB industry and requires more attention. The
research proposed directly approaches this problem by improving upon existing implementations to provide a robust and
accurate solution. In the subsequent sections the objectives will be introduced in [[#sec:objectives]] and the approach for
each objective will be discussed in [[#sec:approach]].
