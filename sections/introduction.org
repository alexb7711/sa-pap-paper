This document outlines a Simulated Annealing (SA) approach to the bus charging scheduling problem that utilizes Mixed
Integer Linear Programming (MILP) constraints to determine feasible charging schedules. The problem involves generating
an optimal charging schedule for a fleet of Battery Electric Buses (BEBs) based on a set of routes and a mix of fast and
slow chargers. The aim is to minimize both the consumption cost (amount of electricity used over a certain time) and the
demand cost (rate at which electricity is being used) while ensuring that the buses maintain sufficient charge to
complete their workday without delays.

The SA algorithm is introduced and constrained by a set of MILP constraints derived from the Position Allocation Problem
(PAP) to ensure the validity of proposed charging schedules. Objective functions describing consumption cost and demand
cost are used to minimize power consumption and total cost of using the BEBs.
