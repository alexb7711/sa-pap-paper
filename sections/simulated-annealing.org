* Simulated Annealing
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:simulated-annealing
:END:
SA is an exploitation oriented, single-solution based (as compared to population based) metaheuristic approach in which
its main advantage is its simplicity both theoretically and in its implementation as well its inherit ability to
overcome nonlinearities [cite:@gendreau-2018-handb-metah;@radosavljevic-2018-metah-optim]. This model is named after its
analogized process where a crystalline solid is heated then allowed to cool very slowly until it achieves its most
regular possible crystal lattice configuration [cite:@henderson-1989-theor-pract]. There are five key components to SA:
initial temperature, cooling schedule (temperature function), generation mechanism, acceptance criteria, local search
iteration count (temperature change counter) [cite:@keller-2019-multi-objec].

** Cooling Equation (Experimental)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cooling-equation-experimental
:END:
The initial temperature and cooling schedule are used to regulate the speed at which the solution attempts to converge
to the best known solution. When the temperature is high, SA encourages exploration. As it cools down (in accordance to
the cooling schedule), it begins to encourage local exploitation of the solution
[cite:@rutenbar-1989-simul-anneal-algor;@henderson-1989-theor-pract]]. There are three basic types of cooling equations as
shown in [[fig:cool]] [cite:@keller-2019-multi-objec]. The different types merely dictate the rate at which the algorithm
progressively disallows exploration. A linear cooling schedule is defined by [[eq:cool0]].

#+name: eq:cool0
\begin{equation}
\Tau[n] = \Tau[n-1] - \Delta_0
\end{equation}

with $\Tau[0] = \Tau_0$ and $\Delta_0 = 1/2\; C^\circ$ in [[fig:cool]]. A geometric cooling schedule is mostly used in practice
[cite:@keller-2019-multi-objec]. It is defined by [[eq:cool1]].

#+name: eq:cool1
\begin{equation}
\Tau[n] = \alpha \Tau[n-1]
\end{equation}

where $\alpha = 0.995$ in [[fig:cool]]. An Exponential cooling schedule is defined by the difference equation is defined as
[[eq:cool2]].

#+name: eq:cool2
\begin{equation}
\Tau[n] = e^{\beta}\Tau[n-1]
\end{equation}

where $\beta = 0.01$ in [[fig:cool]]. The initial temperature, $T_0$, in the case of [[fig:cool]], is set to $500^\circ\; C$ and
each schedule's final temperature is $1\; C^\circ$.

** Acceptance Criteria
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:acceptance
:END:
Acceptance criteria describes the method to accept or reject a given candidate solution. In SA, if a new candidate
solution is more fit than the currently stored solution it is always accepted as the new solution. However, within SA,
worse candidate solutions may be accepted as the new solution. The probability of accepting the candidate solution is
described by the function $\exp(-\frac{J(x) - J(x')}{\Tau})$ where $J(\cdot)$ is the objective functions described in
[[#sec:objective-function]]. The probability of acceptance is a function of the cooling equation just described and
difference of the current solution and a new candidate solution. Let $\Delta E \equiv J(x) - J(x')$ where $x$ is the current
solution and $x'$ is the new candidate solution. The probability of acceptance of $x'$ is defined by [[eq:candaccept]]
[cite:@keller-2019-multi-objec].

#+name: eq:candaccept
\begin{equation}
f(x,x',T) =
\begin{cases}
  1                 & \Delta E > 0 \\
  e^{- \frac{\Delta E}{T}} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

** Generation Mechanisms
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:generators
:END:
Generation mechanisms in SA are used to generate random solutions to propose to the optimizer, these are known as
candidate solutions. In the case of the problem statement made in [[#sec:problem-description]], five generation mechanism
shall be used: new visit, slide visit, new charger, remove, new window. The purpose of each of these generators is to
assign new visits to a charger, adjust a bus visits initial and final charge time within the same time frame/queue,
remove a bus from a charger, and place a bus visit into a new time slot/queue. Each generator will be discussed in more
detail in [[#sec:generators]].

These generator mechanisms will in turn be utilized by two wrapper functions. The schedule generation is to used create
candidate solutions for SA to compare with other solutions, and the perturb schedule generator is used to take a
candidate solution and alter it slightly in an attempt to fall into a global/local minimum.

*** Generator Input/Output
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:generator-input-output
:END:
This section discusses in detail the expected inputs and output of each generator. It is important to discuss these
parameters in order to have an understanding of the generating algorithms derived. The input consists of the bus visit
index of interest, information about the current state of arrivals, $\I$, and the current state of the chargers'
availability, $\C$. The output of each generator affects the tuple of decision variables $(v_i, u_i, d_i) \subset \I_i$.

**** Generator Input
Each generator has the tuple input of $\Sol \equiv (i, \I, \C)$ where $i$ is the visit index, $\I_i$ is the tuple $\visit$
([[#sec:problem-description]]), that describes the set of visits, and $\C$ is the set that describes the availability for
all chargers $q \in \Qset$. In other words, $\C$ defines the set of times when the chargers are not being utilized or are
"inactive".

To derive $\C$, consider its inverse, $\C'$, which is the set of "active" time periods for each charger, $\C' = \bigcup
\{\C_q' : q \in \mathcal{Q}\}$ where $\C_q' \subset \C'$ describes the active times for chagrer $q$. Focusing on an individual charger,
consider $\C_q'$ before a schedule has been imposed upon it, $\C_q' \in \varnothing$. In other words, no buses have been
assigned to be charged over the time period of $[u_i, d_i]$. After the scheduling process is complete, $\C_q'$ will have
a set of active periods of the form $\C_q' \in \{[u_j, d_j]: j \in \Jsetq \}$ where $\Jsetq \subset \mathcal{I}$. For $\C_q'$ to be of
value, its compliment is to be found, $\C_q$. Let $j\text{th}$ inactive period shall be denoted as $\C^j_q$.

To determine the inverse of $\C_q'$, begin by noting $\C_q' \bigcap \{[u_j, d_j] : j \in \Jsetq\} = \varnothing$, is said to be
disjoint [cite:@halmos-1974-naive-set-theor]. The inverse of a disjoint set can be found by the De Morgan Law as shown
in [[eq:demorgan]]. Using [[eq:demorgan]], the set of inactive periods can be written as $\C_q \equiv \bigcup \{[u_j, d_j]': j \in \Jsetq\}$.
Let $\Sol$ denote the tuple $\Sol \equiv (i, \I, \C)$.

#+name: eq:demorgan
\begin{equation}
(A \cap B)' = A' \cup B'
\end{equation}

**** Generator Output
The output is a modified visit, noted as $\I_i'$. In actuality only the decision variables are being altered which is a
subset of $\I_i$. Let this subset be defined by $x_i' \equiv (v_i, u_i, d_i) \subset \I_i$ which is the chosen queue, initial
charge time, and detach time from the generator, $(v_i, u_i, d_i)$. The nature of SA implies that the generators have a
sense of randomness. Because of that, some of the generators may have multiple choices for what $x_i'$ may be. Let the
set of candidates for the output be defined as $x_i' \in X_i'$. Furthermore, set the set of candidate visits be denoted as
$\I_i' \in \I'$.

*** Generators
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:generators
:END:
This section describes and outlines the algorithm pool for the different generator types that are utilized in the
wrapper functions. Note that to satisfy constraints, $B$ extra idle queues that provide no power to the bus. Because of
this, the set of queues is fully defined as $q \in \{1,..., Q, Q+1,..., Q+B\}$ where $Q$ is the total amount of chargers
and $b$ is the bus ID. The use case for this is for when a bus is not to be placed on a charger, it will be placed in
the queue, $v_i \in \{Q+1,..., Q+B\}$, which will satisfy the constraints above while allowing the bus to be "set aside"
while others charge.

**** New visit
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: new-visit
:END:
The new visit generator describes the process of moving bus $b$ from the idle queue, $v_i \in \{Q+1,..., Q+B\}$ to a valid
charging queue, $v_i \in \{1,..., Q\}$. Lines 2-4 extracts the visit, $i$, arrival time, $a_i$, and departure time, $e_i$.
Note that in subsequent algorithms these lines will be omitted for conciseness. Line 5 loops through the inactive time
periods that contain the time the bus is at the station, $[a_i, e_i]$. $\U_{\cdot}$ indicates that an element is selected
randomly with a uniform distribution from the set $\{\cdot\}$. Line 6 verifies that the inactive period selected is valid
and returns a random charging time, $[u_i, d_i]$, if it is. Line 7 returns the new visit.

        \tcc{Randomly select a free time, $j$, from any charger $q \in \Qset$ that is within the time frame $[a_i e_i]$}

        {
            \If(\tcc*[f]{If there is time available in $C_q^j$}){$x_i' \leftarrow$ \findFreeTime{$C_q^j, (a_i, e_i)$} $\not\in \varnothing$}
            {
                \Return{$\I_i' \leftarrow x_i'$} \tcc*[f]{Return visit}
            }
        }
    }
\end{algorithm}

The algorithm to find free time is defined in [[alg:find-free-time]]. $L$ and $U$ are the lower and upper bound of the time
between scheduled times. The possible use cases are depicted in [[fig:find-free]]. In each case depicted by [[fig:find-free]],
the red line shows the arrival and departure time for an arbitrary bus visit, $i$. The blue lines indicate reigons in
which charger $q$ is active. $C \in \C_q \subset \C$ represents one of the regions between the blue lines, $[L, U]$ which stand
for the lower and upper portions of the regions, respectively. The output of [[alg:find-free-time]] is a range for which the
bus may be charged and the empty set if it cannot. As an example, consider a bus that is in the process of being
scheduled and it encounters a situation similar to \autoref{subfig:egu}. That is, the only scheduling constraint is that
the arrival time is before charger $q$ is available to charge the bus. Therefore, the bus must wait intil $L$ before
changer $q$ may charge it. Furthermore, the range that $u_i$ must be selected from is $[L,e]$.

**** Slide visit
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: slide-visit
:END:
Slide visit is used for buses that have already been scheduled. Because of the constraint \ref{seq:c10} there may be
some room to move $u_i$ and $d_i$ within the window $[a_i, e_i]$. Two new values, $u_i$ and $d_i$ are selected with a
uniform distribution to satisfy the constraint $a_i \leq u_i \leq d_i \leq e_i$. Line 2 randomly loops through the other
inactive time frames from charger $v_i$ that is within the time that the bus is at the station, $[a_i, e_i]$. Line 3
verifies the time frame previously selected and returns a new charging time. Line 4 returns the new visit.

The new charger generator takes a visit $\I_i$ and changes the charger it is on while maintianing the same charge time,

Line 2 randomly loops through any time frame from any charger, $C_q^j$, that is within the time frame that the bus is at

The objective of this generator is to generate a candidate solution to the given schedule. To generate a candidate
solution, the generator is given $\I$, a bus is picked at random, $b \in \Bset$, then a random visit is picked. The new
visit generator ([[alg:new-visit]]) is then utilized. This process is repeated for each visit. This algorithm is summarized
in [[alg:schedule-generation]]. Recall from [[#sec:input-variables]], $\Jset_B \subset \I$ is used to indicate the set of visit
indices for bus $b$.
