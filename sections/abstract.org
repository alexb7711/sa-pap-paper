#+latex_header: \abstract{With an increasing adoption of Battery Electric Bus (BEB) fleets, developing a reliable charging schedule is vital to a successful migration from their fossil fuel counterparts. In this paper, a Simulated Annealing (SA) implementation is developed for a charge scheduling framework for a fixed-schedule fleet of BEBs that utilizes a proportional battery dynamics model, accounts for multiple charger types, allows partial charging, and further considers the total energy consumed by the schedule as well as peak power use. Two generation mechanisms are implemented for the SA algorithm denoted as the "quick" and "heuristic" implementations, respectively. The model validity is demonstrated by utilizing a set of routes sampled form the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) and comparing the results againts two other models: the PAP and the Qin-Modified. The results presented show that both techniques offer a means of generating oprationally feasible schedules quickly while minimizing the cost of operation and considering battery health. The heuristic technique, hower, shaws a quicker rate of convergence.}
