This section combines the generation algorithms and the optimization problem into a single algorithm. It begins with an
introduction and discussion of a general SA algorithm which will be used to springboard into the construction of the SA
PAP algorithm.

** Simulated Annealing Pseudo Code

Let $\omega$ and $\bar{\omega}$ denote the active solution and the candidate solution, respectively. Let $\Tau$ be the temperature
function and $\Tau_0$ the initial temperature. Furthermore, let $t$ be defined as the vector of temperatures defined by
$t = \Tau(\Tau_0)$, and let $t_m$ be defined as being an element of $t$, $t_m \in t$. Let $n_K$ be the repetition counter,
it defines the number of iterations to execute exploit a solution at a constant temperature $t_m$.

Recall the objective of the SA algorithm is to iteratively create a neighboring candidate solution from the active
solution. The fitness of the two solutions are compared and if the candidate solution is of a higher quality, it is
always taken as the active solution. If it is not, then it may be selected as the new candidate solution with some
probability that is a function of the difference in the objective function values and the current temperature. This
process is iteratively done until the temperature function reaches its minimum value. With the high level summary in
mind, the SA pseudocode is to be presented [cite:@henderson-1989-theor-pract].

The algorithm behaves as follows: Lines 1 and 2 of \ref{alg:sa-pseudo} initialize the SA algorithm the temperature
schedule, $t$, and active solution, $\omega$, respectively. The outer loop on Line 3 iterates through all the temperature
values in $t$. After each iteration of the outer loop, the temperature is decreased as specified by the selected
temperature function. Line 4 resets the iteration counter to 0. Line 5 specifies the inner loop that iterates $n_K$
times at a constant temperature, $t_k$. Line 6, perturbs the active solution $\omega$ to a neighboring candidate solution
$\bar{\omega} = N(\omega)$. Line 7 then calculates the difference in the fitness of $\omega$ and $\bar{\omega}$. Lines 8-13 updates $\omega$ with
$\bar{\omega}$ if the candidate solution is more fit, or updates $\omega$ with $\bar{\omega}$ with probability $e^{\frac{-\Delta_{\omega ,
\bar{\omega}}}{t_m}}$ if the candidate solution is less fit than the active solution. Line 14 updates the repetition counter.

** SA PAP Pseudo Code
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:sa-pap-pseudo-code
:END:

Now that the general SA algorithm has been outlined, the objective is now to outline SA-PAP (\ref{alg:sa-pap}). While
the SA PAP generally is written almost identically to that of the general SA algorithm, the general SA assumes that the
generated candidate solutions are in the solution space of the problem, $\omega \in S$ where $S$ is the solution space.
Initialization and the perturbation of a schedule must be verified to ensure that the generated schedule is in the
solution space. Therefore, the objective function and constraints introduced in [[#sec:constraints]] and
[[#sec:objective-function]], respectively, must be employed to verify that the output of
\ref{alg:charge-schedule-generation} is in the feasible space, $S$.

As previously stated, the generating functions directly influence the values of the assigned charge queue, charge
initialization time, and charge completion time: $q_i$, $u_i$, and $d_i$, respectively. Having generated those values,
the rest of the decision variables may be derived. Let's begin by reviewing over the packing constraints.
\ref{seq:c0}-\ref{seq:c1} are employed to enable and disable $\sigma_{ij}$ and $\psi_{ij}$ and \ref{seq:c2}-\ref{seq:c4} ensure
the validity of the values. \ref{seq:c5} can be directly calculated and \ref{seq:c8} is fully defined.

Changing the focus over to the dynamic constraints, similarly to what was seen with the packing constraints, the battery
dynamic constraints are also fully defined and can be calculated. \ref{seq:c6} is sequentially calculated after a given
schedule has been fully defined. \ref{seq:c7} is evaluated to ensure the BEB is not overcharged. The penalty method
implemented in [[#sec:objective-function]] is set in place to allow the SOC to go below the specified threshold, $\nu_{\Xi_i}
\kappa_{\Xi_i}$, but punish the solution for doing so. Thus, over time, the candidate solutions will be encouraged toward a
solution that does not activate the penalty method (i.e. is solution is truly feasible).

The SA-PAP algorithm in \ref{alg:sa-pap} will now be outlined. Line 2 initializes the SA algorithm by creating a vector
of temperature values based on a temperature schedule $\Tau$, and initial temperature $\Tau_0$. Line 3 generates the
initial candidate solution $\omega$, note that $CSG(\cdot)$ (candidate solution generator) is used to denote the specific
candidate solution generator being utilized. For SA PAP it is \ref{alg:charge-schedule-generation}. Line 4 loops through
each of the step in the temperature schedule $t_m \in t$. Line 5 resets the iteration count to 0. Line 6 specifies the
inner loop that iterates $n_K$ times at a constant temperature, $t_k$. Line 7, perturbs the active solution $\omega$ to a
neighboring candidate solution $\bar{\omega} = PS(\omega)$, where $PS(\cdot)$ (perturb schedule) is \ref{alg:perturb-schedule}. Line 8
calculates the difference in the fitness of $\omega$ and $\bar{\omega}$. Lines 8-14 are similar to \ref{alg:sa-pseudo} where it
updates $\omega$ with $\bar{\omega}$ if the candidate solution is more fit, or updates $\omega$ with $\bar{\omega}$ with probability
$e^{\frac{-\Delta_{\bar{\omega},\omega}}{t_m}}$ if the candidate solution is less fit than the active solution. What makes these lines
unique is that the active solution is only updated if the candidate is within the solution space. That it, it satisfies
the constraints defined in \ref{eq:constraints}.
